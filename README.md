<h3>Learning CMake for Future Projects ðŸ’»</h3> 


During my journey of learning c, I went through various compilation methods until I met cmake, which made life a bit easier.

This is a small project with some of the main techniques applied to cmake during compilation of an executable, they are functional in windows, linux and mac, there are 3 examples in this repository:

<ul>
    <li>Executable</li>
    <li>Executable + libs</li>
    <li>Executable + libs with conditions</li>
</ul>

They all have a CMakeLists file where the compilation characteristics are defined.
