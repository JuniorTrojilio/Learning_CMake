<h3>Learning CMake for Future Projects ðŸ’»</h3> 


During my journey of learning language c, I went through various compilation methods until I met cmake, which made life a bit easier.

This is a small project with some of the main techniques applied to cmake during compilation of an executable, they are functional in windows, linux and mac, there are 3 examples in this repository:
<blockquote>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/JuniorTrojilio/Learning_CMake/tree/master/Create_Executable">Executable</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/JuniorTrojilio/Learning_CMake/tree/master/Create_a_exe_and_lib">Executable + libs</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/JuniorTrojilio/Learning_CMake/tree/master/Conditional_Construct">Executable + libs with conditions</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/JuniorTrojilio/Learning_CMake/tree/master/Using_Option">Using Options</a>
</ul>
</blockquote>

They all have a CMakeLists file where the compilation characteristics are defined.
